# SCA-Cloud-School-Application
Jenkins pipeline syntax used for Jenkinsfile.
=============================================
Syntax
------
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Taiwo is getting into SCA-Cloud-School-Application.'
            }
        }
    }
}

It is a very simple pipeline which is only doing one step for build.
And it is prompting with the "Taiwo is getting into SCA-Cloud-School-Application."
